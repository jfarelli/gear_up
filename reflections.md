1. What were your reflections from the video?
* **I've heard of "inherent bias" before this, and also have first hand experience**
  **as a result of my own unconscious attitude towards individuals when I would either**
  **interview them for a position, greet someone, or just people watch.**
* **Everyone has it. Even the most positive of individuals has some attitude**
  **towards someone they just met, be it positive or negative.**
<br></br>
<br></br>
2. In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
* **Many times I've met someone and just not liked them. However, when I find myself**
  **internally discriminating over this individual (for no good reason), I've recently asked myself "Why?".**
* **What did they do to me??? Nothing. So, why am I pre-judging?**
* **When I find myself in these situations, I reflect on if anyone has thought this**
  **way about me, and how it could have affected my opportunities.**
* **Now, when I meet someone, I listen and get to know them, because the one you**
  **push away could be the one you need.**
<br></br>
<br></br>
3. What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?
* **Wow, what a question...I haven't even thought about specifics like that, but**
  **when I do get into a technical profession, I know that I'll have to analyze the type of**
  **person who will use it. And, I will have to look at a lot of different factors**
  **to see who this would be beneficial for.**

4. When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
* I love meeting new people, even though I find myself anxious at times when I'm around people I don't know. However, I don't like to let that feeling overpower me, because I've been down that road before and it didn't lead me on the right path.

5. What strengths does your identity give you? How will you utilize those at Turing?
* I like being heavily collaborative. I feel that that is the best way to learn and grow.
* I would take that mindset into Turing for work on future projects, homework, etc...
<br></br>
<br></br>
6. How do you think you could value the identities of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
* I would value the identities of my fellow classmates at Turing by assessing their strengths and empowering them to move forward with an idea, a question, or a response based on those strengths. If they're shy, I would empower them to speak up. If they're abrasive, I would suggest for them to take a breath and think about the situation before responding.
* In my last career we were heavily collaborative as we worked through the design process. If we ever got stuck on something, if I knew there was someone in another division who could give us a fresh set of eyes and let us know what they think from their perspective, I would invite them in and hear what they had to say.

7. How will your strengths impact you as a teammate? What will you bring to your cohort?
* I have a desire to learn and grow. I'm working on myself constantly, because, as they say, "if you're not growing,
  you're dying".
* I'm a strong teammate, because I have a good work ethic and I'm not here to "take it in stride".
* I love working with people and I look forward to future collaboration with my teammates.
